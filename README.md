## Arjo's Xournal

Installation:  see `INSTALL` (please do the `$HOME` install)

### My customizations:

- The pen cursor looks absolute shit in original xournal, so I reverted to
  original mouse format which is more to my liking.
- Please try the `$HOME` installation.
- I intend to fix some issues regarding zooming and effect of creating `new
  page`.
